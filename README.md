# Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This project utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), to predict customer churn. By analyzing historical customer data, the model can identify patterns and predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not.

 The model achieves an accuracy of 77%, making it a valuable tool for businesses to anticipate and mitigate customer churn.
